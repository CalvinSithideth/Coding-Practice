Assignment:
What's wrong with the following code?
Modify it to produce the intended output.

Make sure to properly utilize if/else/if statements
to avoid redundancy and avoid unnecessary tests.

Do not use && or || in your solution.


Original code:

int percent = getInteger("What percentage did you earn? ");
if (percent >= 90) {
    cout << "You got an A!" << endl;
}
if (percent >= 80) {
    cout << "You got a B!" << endl;
}
if (percent >= 70) {
    cout << "You got a C!" << endl;
}
if (percent >= 60) {
    cout << "You got a D!" << endl;
}
if (percent < 60) {
    cout << "You got an F!" << endl;
}


Solution (bare code):
 */


int percent = getInteger("What percentage did you earn? ");
if (percent >= 90) {
    cout << "You got an A!" << endl;
}
else if (percent >= 80) {
    cout << "You got a B!" << endl;
}
else if (percent >= 70) {
    cout << "You got a C!" << endl;
}
else if (percent >= 60) {
    cout << "You got a D!" << endl;
}
else { // (percent < 60)
    cout << "You got an F!" << endl;
}
