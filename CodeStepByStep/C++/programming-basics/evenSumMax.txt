/*
C++ - Programming Basics - evenSumMax
Assignment:
Write a function named evenSum that prompts the user for many integers and
print the total even sum and maximum of the even numbers.

You may assume that the user types at least one non-negative even integer.

how many integers? 4
next integer? 2
next integer? 9
next integer? 18
next integer? 4
even sum = 24
even max = 18


Solution (function exercise):
 */


void evenSum()
{
    int numIntegers = 0;
    int currInteger;
    int evenSum = 0;
    int evenMax = 0;
    cout << "how many integers? ";
    cin >> numIntegers;
    for (int i = 0; i < numIntegers; i++)
    {
        cout << "next integer? ";
        cin >> currInteger;
        if (currInteger % 2 == 0)
        {
            evenSum += currInteger;
            if (currInteger > evenMax) // Check max after verified even num
            {
                evenMax = currInteger;
            }
        }
    }
    cout << "even sum = " << evenSum;
    cout << endl; // Only time we need endl - std::cin has implicit endl
    cout << "even max = " << evenMax;
}
