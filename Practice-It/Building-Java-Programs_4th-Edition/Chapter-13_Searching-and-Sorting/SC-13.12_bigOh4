Assignment: 

Approximate the runtime of the following code fragment, in terms of n:
Write your answer in a format such as "O(N^2)" or "O(N log N)" (without the quotes).

int sum = 0;
for (int i = 1; j <= n; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= i; j+= 2) {
        sum += 4;
    }
}
for (int k = -50; k <= -1; k++) {
    sum--;
}

Solution (Self-Check):
 */
