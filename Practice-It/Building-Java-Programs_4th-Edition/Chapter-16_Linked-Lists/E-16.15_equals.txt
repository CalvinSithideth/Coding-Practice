/*
BJP4 Exercise 16.15: equals
Assignment: 

Write a method equals2 that accepts a second list as a parameter and
that returns true if the two lists are equal and that returns false otherwise.
Two lists are considered equal if they store exactly the same values in
exactly the same order and have exactly the same length.

(Note: On the original section handout, this method is called equals;
but Practice-It already defines an equals method for LinkedIntList for internal use,
so we must call your method equals2 here to avoid a conflict.)

Assume that you are adding this method to the LinkedIntList class as defined below:

public class LinkedIntList {
    private ListNode front;   // null for an empty list
    ...
}


Solution (partial class problem):
*/


public boolean equals2(LinkedIntList otherList) {
    
    ListNode walkerOne;
    ListNode walkerTwo;
    
    if ( this.size() != otherList.size() ) {
        return false;
    }
    else if (this.front == null && otherList.front == null) {
        return true;
    }
    
    walkerOne = this.front;
    walkerTwo = otherList.front;
    
    if (walkerOne.data != walkerTwo.data) {
        return false;
    }
    
    while ( walkerOne.next != null ) {
        walkerOne = walkerOne.next;
        walkerTwo = walkerTwo.next;
        if ( walkerOne.data != walkerTwo.data ) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
