BJP4 Exercise 18.1: addAllHashIntSet
Assignment:

Write a method named addAll that could be placed inside the HashIntSet class.
This method accepts another HashIntSet as a parameter and adds all elements from
that set into the current set, if they are not already present.

For example, if a set s1 contains [1, 2, 3] and
another set s2 contains [1, 7, 3, 9], the call of s1.addAll(s2);
would change s1 to store [1, 2, 3, 7, 9] in some order.

You are allowed to call methods on your set and/or the other set.
Do not modify the set passed in.

This method should run in O(N) time where N is the number of elements in the
parameter set passed in.


Solution (partial class problem):
*/


public void addAll(HashIntSet s) {
	for ( int i = 0; i < s.elementData.length; i++ ) { // Check each hash bucket
		if ( s.elementData[i] != null ) {
			Node current = s.elementData[i];
			while ( current != null ) {
				add( current.data );
				current = current.next;
			}
		}
	}
}
