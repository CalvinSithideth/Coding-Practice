BJP4 Exercise 15.12: removeFront
Assignment: 

Write a method removeFront that takes an integer n as a parameter and
that removes the first n values from a list of integers.

For example, if a variable called list stores this sequence of values:

[8, 17, 9, 24, 42, 3, 8]

and the following call is made:

list.removeFront(4);

It should store the following after the call:

[42, 3, 8]

Notice that the first four values in the list have been removed and
the other values appear in the same order as in the original list.
You may assume that the parameter value passed is between 0 and
the size of the list inclusive.


Assume you are adding to the ArrayIntList class with following fields:


public class ArrayIntList {
    private int[] elementData;
    private int size;

    // your code goes here
}


Solution (partial class problem):
*/


public void removeFront(int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        this.remove(0);
    }
}
